                        Describing his life in <i>Memoirs of Haiti</i>, Roger
                        Dorsinville takes the reader (or listener) on a journey
                        through a collage of recollections that relate to his
                        childhood and early manhood in Haiti. Although many
                        factors influence the shaping of his youth, the
                        consciousness and conception of his father are
                        particularly significant. Starting at the age of six, a
                        strained and silent relationship ultimately trains and
                        shapes the son. Living in his father&rsquo;s shadow for
                        many years, he only begins to emerge from this when his
                        life goes uncontrollably off course when he is tried for
                        sedition and jailed. In a strange and – to say the least
                        – uncomfortable situation for the first time, the son is
                        forced to reach inside himself to address and solve it.
                        It is at this point in time that he begins the process
                        of unearthing an identity – and a voice – separate from
                        his father, and thus starts the transformation that will
                        forever change the shape of his future.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Recalling his childhood in chapter one of
                        <i>Memoirs of Haiti</i>, when he was three or four, the
                        speaker describes his first memory of his father. In
                        this memory, there is no connection or relationship
                        between the two. He describes his father as a « growling
                        shadow [who was] seen only at the end of the day » (18).
                        Here, the word « growling » describes a man whose spoken
                        words come out vaguely, obscurely, and even menacingly,
                        while the word « shadow » connotes mystery, foreignness
                        and the unknown. The mystery imported into the
                        description by these two words is furthered by his
                        portraying him as someone who was seen only at the end
                        of the day, which thus places him in the liminal (and
                        indefinite) period between day and night. Thus, in this
                        earliest memory, the speaker refers to a man who is
                        immersed in shadows and mystery, and who is entirely
                        detached from his son.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Chapter two, however, marks a turning point in
                        <i>Memoirs of Haiti</i>, and thus, in the life of the
                        speaker as a child. Recalling his life at the age of
                        six, he tells the reader (or listener) that his father
                        began to spend more time at home. As a result, men from
                        the neighbourhood gathered at the family house on
                        Sundays to discuss literature, politics and current
                        events. The child also attended these meetings, which
                        enabled him to become « not only conscious of his
                        [father&rsquo;s] presence, but also of his
                        [father&rsquo;s] personality » (29). The development of
                        this « consciousness » obviously contrasts with the
                        mystery surrounding his earlier childhood memory, and
                        allows the son, for the first time, to see his father as
                        more than a vague presence or a « growling shadow. »
                        Becoming aware of both his father&rsquo;s presence
                        <i>and</i> personality, the son initiates his emergence
                        from the shadow that engulfed him in the earlier
                        childhood memory.

                      <p>
                        <a name="r1"></a>     Once conscious of his father, he
                        not only begins to know his progenitor, but also begins
                        to cultivate a relationship with him. However, the awe
                        that surrounded the six-year old child with « the birth
                        of the father » is quickly replaced by a troubled
                        understanding of the fundamentals of this new
                        relationship. In the Sunday group settings wherein he
                        was able to observe his father, the child describes him
                        as a group leader, [<a href="#1">1</a>] a smooth talker
                        and « a fine man of the word » (30). But aside from this
                        group and on a personal level, he describes his
                        interaction with his father simply and bluntly, telling
                        the reader (or listener) that he « didn&rsquo;t talk
                        much with [his] father » (98) and that in fact, they
                        « practically never spoke » (98). Consequently, filial
                        relationship, once established, is characterized by a
                        total lack of dialogue and verbal communication.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For the older writer looking back on his childhood the
                        lack of dialogue that characterized his relationship
                        with his father is clearly seen in a negative way. This
                        is effectively shown to the reader (or listener) in a
                        revealing statement. In it, the father is described as
                        someone who « hid behind his trademark silence » (59).
                        Firstly, the fact that the word « trademark » is used
                        shows (again) how the father (and the relationship
                        between father and son) is described in terms of
                        silence. It also shows, however, that this silence is
                        found to be cowardly – the speaker tells the reader (or
                        listener) that his father was someone who « hid » behind
                        it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Two exceptions to the father&rsquo;s « trademark »
                        silence are described. In the first, the father is
                        portrayed as someone who breaks his silence only
                        momentarily, to bark out an order or command. One clear
                        example of this is the story related to the reader (or
                        listener) about the new camera the speaker and his
                        brother bought. Proudly showing their first photos, the
                        only response the two sons received from their father
                        was « No tie? You had no tie on at the Champ-de-Mars? A
                        Dorsinville does not go out without wearing a tie »
                        (68). Thus, silence is momentarily interrupted to
                        « correct » the boys. This interruption does not involve
                        any dialogue or discussion – it is simply an order to be
                        accepted and followed by the two sons.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With the second exception, however, the reader (or
                        listener) is told of a softer side. Discussing the
                        hunting trips that used to take place with his father
                        and his brother, the speaker fondly recalls the car
                        rides to and fro. During this time, « there&rsquo;d be
                        little exchanges between a relaxed father and his
                        teenage sons » (98). These « little exchanges, »
                        although not equal to serious and deep conversation,
                        allowed the sons to share and communicate directly and
                        verbally with their progenitor, which in turn allowed
                        them to see another side of him. This « relaxed »
                        version of fatherhood contrasts with the prevailing
                        strained and silent image, and thus creates a sense of
                        comfort and happiness not present in many of the other
                        recollections.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But, as already noted, these instances are exceptions,
                        and few moments of verbal exchange are represented
                        between father and son. In light of an obviously lacking
                        dialogic form of communication between them, the son
                        develops a nonverbal form of communication through
                        writing. Describing this, the writer says, « I started
                        [writing] early, from the age of fourteen, I think. My
                        brother and I wrote reviews of films, plays and lectures
                        for our father&rsquo;s daily newspaper » (51). The fact
                        that he started writing at such a young age is in itself
                        an important detail, indicating the early development of
                        this « other » form of communication. But, the fact that
                        he and his brother both develop and target their writing
                        to the father&rsquo;s paper (as opposed to some personal
                        venture), indicates how both he and his brother rely on
                        the written word to communicate with their father.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        While further discussing the development of this form of
                        communication, the writer says, « at first, he [the
                        father] corrected our prose, then he stopped. He was
                        proud of our writings at sixteen or seventeen. We heard
                        of that through friends. He did not praise us face to
                        face. We knew our pieces were good when he read them in
                        our presence and accepted them » (51). This is a
                        revealing statement on many levels. Firstly, the reader
                        (or listener) is given the image of the father silently
                        correcting the prose of the sons, and then handing it
                        back for them to read and understand (note the entire
                        lack of verbal exchange). As the sons&rsquo; writing
                        improved, however, the written corrections are replaced
                        with a silence indicative of acceptance. The only verbal
                        connection between father and son is the praise that
                        must travel to the sons second-hand, through the
                        father&rsquo;s friends. Thus, direct communication only
                        occurs through the written word, which passes from the
                        pen of the sons to the eyes of the father, and then back
                        to the sons without the utterance of a single word.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Ultimately, through the development of a silent
                        relationship with his father, and the cultivation of
                        writing as a main form of communication with him,
                        Dorsinville develops not only a consciousness of the
                        father, but also a conception of himself. The sense of
                        self that he develops is intricately linked with the
                        position and identity of his father and his
                        father&rsquo;s friends, and the writer describes this,
                        telling the reader (or listener) that « you can see how
                        we [he and his brother] were trained to reach for an
                        ideal. <a name="r2"></a>It was out of the question we
                        would turn out less…In that sense, my father and his
                        friends were our models » (30-31).[<a href="#2">2</a>]
                        The father and the friends, who act as role models, thus
                        « train » (which connotes rote learning and repetition
                        while minimizing, or entirely omitting, active thinking)
                        the sons to reach for an ideal represented by the father
                        and his friends. Diverging or changing from such a
                        prescribed course is simply « out of the question. »
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This « natural order, » where the son follows in the
                        footsteps of his father, and where it is « out of the
                        question » for him to turn out to do anything less,
                        ultimately relates to what the speaker calls
                        Haiti&rsquo;s « suicidal cycle. » Describing this cycle,
                        he says, « we&rsquo;re talking about a very unusual
                        society whose main characteristic is to turn in a circle
                        within a value system that spurs each one to move up a
                        bit, in search of some betterment » (60). Key words in
                        this statement are « a bit » and « some, » which
                        indicate a very small or moderate betterment or
                        transformation, but which outlaw any major ameliorations
                        or drastic changes. This, combined with the fact that
                        the value system is described as a « circle, » which has
                        no beginning and no end, and repeats itself over and
                        over, presents the reader (or listener) with the image
                        of a stagnant society. Stuck in this circle, a person
                        can only improve a bit on what has already been done,
                        but ultimately, can never deviate or break free.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <a name="r3"></a>     For the speaker, the natural order
                        [<a href="#3">3</a>] that he has been trained to follow
                        is that of the « little bourgeois » (34, 48). And,
                        through his childhood and early manhood, he does indeed
                        follow this path – he attends school, gets good grades
                        (except one year) and graduates with success. Recalling
                        this period of his life, the writer characterizes it by
                        its total lack of independent thought. He says « I went
                        through the school system like a serf; and after that I
                        studied on my own – law, for example, learning by rote,
                        like a serf…I read a lot; I practiced sport; I
                        discovered sex – things I focused on in response to
                        physical urges » (46-47). The self-deprecating
                        description of himself as a « serf, » the fact that he
                        learned by rote, and the connection of these events to
                        only the physical – and never the mental – urges show
                        how this period in his life unfolded along a set path of
                        mediocrity, instead of a self-determining one with a
                        goal.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Even after the death of his father (which occurred when
                        the writer was eighteen), the son is unable to
                        « wake-up » (47) from this unthinking path. Describing
                        his first major solo decision after his father passed
                        away – what to do with his life – the speaker tells the
                        reader (or listener) that he ultimately decided to join
                        the military. What is so interesting about this first
                        major decision, however, is the way he describes making
                        it, and the paradox that surrounds it. He says that he
                        never « really [chose] to become an army officer » (52),
                        and that, rather, he just followed « the easy way »
                        (52). Consequently, this first key independent decision
                        is one that was not consciously made (hence, the
                        paradox; making a decision without thinking about it).
                        So, even after the death of his father, the son
                        continues along the carefree and thought-free path to
                        which he has become accustomed, making decisions about
                        his life that never involve active thought.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The military, however, offers more than just a carefree
                        path. It also, in many ways, acts as a replacement for
                        the dead father, and thus offers a milieu that the
                        writer gets used to. Firstly, when discussing the
                        military, he characterizes it as the « camp of the mute
                        ones » (52). To the reader (or listener), this must
                        immediately recall the father&rsquo;s « trademark »
                        silence. Also, the relationship that the son establishes
                        with the chief or « father » of the army, Calixte, is
                        remarkably reminiscent of his relationship with his
                        natural father. For example, after hearing the rumors of
                        the impending assassination of Armand, Dorsinville
                        approaches Calixte for information. But, as he recounts
                        to the reader (or listener), Calixte simply tells him to
                        « see Bonhomme » (79). The terseness of this
                        conversation, its total lack of dialogic interaction,
                        along with the fact that Calixte also transmits
                        information second-hand (like Dorsinville&rsquo;s
                        father&rsquo;s praise, which had to travel to his son
                        through the father&rsquo;s friends) immediately recalls
                        the son&rsquo;s interaction with his father.

                      <p>
                        At age twenty-six, the life of this « aimless youth
                        pursuing fleeting joys like little flowers in a gray
                        countryside » (47) is turned upside-down. Because of his
                        role in the Armand assassination conspiracy (which
                        failed), the once proud and carefree soldier of the
                        state is arrested and detained as an enemy of the state.
                        The word <i>role</i> is italicized here, because, as
                        Dorsinville points out in his defense plea, his only
                        real role in the assassination plot was that he was
                        aware of it, hence his only « real mistake » (207) was
                        that he didn&rsquo;t denounce the « father » of the
                        plan, Calixte. The « son » is ultimately arrested for
                        following the father – which is something that he has
                        been trained to do since he became conscious of his
                        biological father at the age of six (with « the birth of
                        the father. »)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Showing just how much Dorsinville&rsquo;s father
                        influenced him prior to his arrest is a salient feature
                        in the speaker&rsquo;s memory. The reader (or listener)
                        is told that his relatives, worried not only about his
                        imprisonment, but also his life, suggested that he flee
                        Haiti for the Bahamas. His response was to immediately –
                        and absolutely – deny this possibility. He simply said
                        that « there was no way Hénec&rsquo;s [his
                        father&rsquo;s] son was going to escape like a thief »
                        (85). What is important to note in this response is that
                        Dorsinville does not say that he, personally, decided
                        not to escape. Rather, he defines his decision not to
                        run in terms of his father – « Hénec&rsquo;s son » would
                        never escape like a thief. Defining himself as
                        « Hénec&rsquo;s son » shows how the speaker, at the age
                        of twenty-six, still defines himself in terms of the
                        father, and still follows in his shadow.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When he is finally arrested, however, and put in prison,
                        Dorsinville turns to reading. Having brought a book with
                        him, he tells the reader (or listener) that the subject
                        of the book (which was philosophy) was irrelevant to
                        him, and rather, the significance of the book was in its
                        « capacity to hold back one&rsquo;s own thinking » (87).
                        When the book is taken away, however, he is left alone
                        with only his thoughts. Now, with nothing left to do but
                        delve into his own mind for comfort and reason, he tells
                        the reader (or listener) that he « began to think for
                        [himself] » (47). This is a defining moment in
                        <i>Memoirs of Haiti</i>, and (hence) in the life of
                        Roger Dorsinville since, for the first time, he thinks
                        freely and independently. This moment marks the
                        beginning of the individual&rsquo;s transformation, and
                        the concrete emergence of the son from the shadow of the
                        father.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This « consciousness of self, » characterized by the
                        development of independent thought, is marked by
                        Dorsinville&rsquo;s famous and monumental Defense Plea.
                        An important work in many ways, its main significance in
                        this context relates to the way in which it was
                        presented. Although written by Dorsinville, the plea was
                        designed to be spoken – to use the verbal word to
                        approach others, to communicate and to explain. The
                        first paragraph of the Defense Plea illustrates this
                        intent, « we intend to defend ourselves so that our
                        silence not be falsely interpreted as a vain display of
                        pride » (207). Silence – the « trademark » of the father
                        – is thus something that is rejected here. Seriously
                        thinking for himself for the first time, Dorsinville
                        replaces the silence and the written form of
                        communication that he learned so well from his father
                        with the dialogue and the spoken word that he learned by
                        himself.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The transformation, which began in prison with the
                        development of independent thought and dialogue, allows
                        the son to consolidate the process of emergence from the
                        shadow of his father. Once started, he never follows the
                        father figure blindly again. As Estimé&rsquo;s chief of
                        staff, Dorsinville is the one who puts the words of
                        leadership into the mouth of the leader, with his oath
                        of office speech (thus reversing the roles of father and
                        son as he has known them). After two years with Estimé,
                        he proves to be too much of a « shit disturber » (164)
                        and he is offered (offered without choice) another
                        position away from Haiti, in New York (as Haiti&rsquo;s
                        consul). Likewise, as Duvalier&rsquo;s ambassador, he is
                        pushed further and further away from Haiti – first to
                        Costa Rica, and then to Africa. Since one does not go to
                        such lengths for a follower, it is clear that both
                        leaders, father figures fearful of Dorsinville (the
                        rebellious « son ») and of his (independent) opinions,
                        push him away from Haiti in order to distance and
                        silence him.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But, as <i>Memoirs of Haiti</i> bears witness, the
                        « fathers' » attempted suppression of the « son » by
                        distancing and silencing him backfired.
                        <a name="r4"></a>Dorsinville was never silenced.
                        Banished to Africa, alone and away from his home, he
                        describes himself as « a man cut off from his Haitian
                        roots who, in order to survive and preserve his sanity,
                        married into an African family. » [<a href="#4">4</a>]
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The African family, however, does not act as a
                        replacement for the Haitian one. In fact, this African
                        family (« the many ») actually opposes
                        Dorsinville&rsquo;s Haitian father (« the one »), and
                        thus offers him a milieu rich in dialogue and sharing.
                        Ultimately, this encourages Dorsinville to expand upon
                        the transformation that he began in Haiti, and to break
                        free of his father&rsquo;s training forever.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Notes:</h3>
                      <p>
                        <a name="1"></a>1. Dorsinville never describes his
                        father directly to the reader, but it is implied in his
                        narrative. All the friends gather at the Dorsinville
                        family house, and around Dorsinville&rsquo;s father. As
                        the center of attention of these meetings, it is
                        inferred that Dorsinville&rsquo;s father was the leader
                        of these meetings. [<a href="#r1">return to text</a>]
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <a name="2"></a>2. Here, Dorsinville refers to the
                        father and the friends of the father. This connection
                        between the father and his friends is actually discussed
                        in the second chapter, « The Birth of the Father. »
                        There, Dorsinville spends a lot of time discussing the
                        « brilliant talkers, » like Félix Viard, the « gifted
                        professionals, » like Dr. Félix Coicou, and the « modest
                        people, » like Clément Beaugé. This focus on the
                        father&rsquo;s friends is important since these
                        individual descriptions all relate back to the father,
                        because the men « were part of the emerging personality
                        of (Dorsinville&rsquo;s) father. » Thus, the men who
                        emerged alongside the father also became intertwined
                        with Dorsinville&rsquo;s conception of his father. [<a
                          href="#r2"
                          >return to text</a
                        >]
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <a name="3"></a>3. Perhaps Dorsinville&rsquo;s
                        dissatisfaction with « the natural order » is
                        foreshadowed by the title of his second chapter, The
                        Birth of the Father. When analyzing the meaning of the
                        title, the reader (or listener) understands that the
                        father is born of the son. But to have the father born
                        to the son is a conundrum, since, following the natural
                        order, the son is born to the father. Consequently, the
                        title implies a willed act of subversion of the natural
                        order. [<a href="#r3">return to text</a>]
