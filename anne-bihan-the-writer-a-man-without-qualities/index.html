                        If, as the Argentinean writer Juan José Saer [<a
                          href="#2"
                          >2</a

                        the thick virgin forest of the real, » if the writer
                        must remain against all odds « the keeper of the
                        possible » and « refuse to represent, as a writer, any

                        dogma, even though he/she is thereby condemned to
                        marginality and obscurity » [<a href="#3">3</a>], the
                        issue of identity might become a snare in which writing
                        could be trapped and diverted from its only raison
                        d&rsquo;être: a human being exercising a radical
                        freedom, expressed in a praxis that is, by definition,
                        hesitant, uncontrollable and impossible for the social
                        norm to appropriate, even in an « emerging, » supposedly
                        « post-colonial » context where this insubordination –
                        this experience of independence – also plays its role of
                        major witness, in a manner that is perhaps even more
                        perceptible than anywhere else.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        What kind of a testimony is the act of writing? What
                        does literature reveal, not only here and now in
                        Oceania, but also in China, Africa, Latin America and
                        Europe?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in
                        Literature in Stockholm on 7 December 2000, Gao Xingjian
                        [<a href="#4">4</a>], who fought censorship and the
                        almighty power of the Communist system, gave a
                        categorical response to these questions: « What I want
                        to say here is that literature can only be the voice of
                        the individual and it has always been so. Once
                        literature is contrived as a hymn to a country, the
                        standard bearer of a nation, the mouthpiece of a
                        political party or the voice of a particular class or
                        group, it can be employed as a powerful, all-engulfing
                        tool of propaganda. However, such writing loses what is
                        inherent to literature, ceases to be literature at all,
                        and becomes a tool serving power and vested interests,
                        whatever the means made available for its diffusion and
                        however successful its reach. »
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Hence we have a voice, « inevitably weak »&#8230; « weak
                        and discordant, » according to the author of <em
                          >Soul Mountain</em
                        >, borne by an « ordinary man, » a voice telling of the
                        consciousness of what it is to be human and to be
                        present in the world. In the daily practice of writing,
                        this awareness finds its expression in the endless
                        search for a language to tell « what has yet to be
                        said. » It is thus a question of identity – understood
                        as what gives things a name, identifies them – that is
                        not fixed, once and for all, but rather ever changing,
                        ever about to come.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This brings to mind the words of Jean-Marie Tjibaou [<a
                          href="#5"
                          >5</a
                        >] that have been repeated so many times over the past
                        years that their intensity can sometimes fade: « Our
                        identity lies in front of us » [<a href="#6">6</a>].
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Of course, these words should not be diverted from their
                        struggle for the recognition of « Melanesian man, »
                        showing that there is « another way to express
                        mankind, » subject, as he stated, to a « permanent
                        reformulation. » To do so would jeopardise the noblest
                        dimension of communication: that of dialogue between
                        individuals. How can one individual among the throng of
                        humanity go out and meet others without knowing who s/he
                        is, without knowing the land(s) and the individuals
                        whose history and permanence, but also whose creative
                        power, s/he expresses, here and now.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        By denying this fundamental need for an identity and a
                        territory [<a href="#7">7</a>], the current
                        globalisation process endlessly turns borders into walls
                        punctuated with watchtowers and illusory identities
                        reduced to their most deadly form, murderers [<a
                          href="#8"
                          >8</a
                        >].
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        « In front of us. » Jean-Marie Tjibaou was a great
                        listener and a man of forgiveness, a peacemaker; the
                        words he spoke still echo strongly in the debate that
                        concerns us here. Because this « in front of us » turns
                        out to be, in its own way, the keeper of what is
                        possible. It expresses the refusal to be inward-looking
                        or contained. It reveals the impetus for a permanent
                        construction that is implied in the work of being human,
                        which, as living creatures, we are called upon to carry
                        out. It defines identity not by qualifying or
                        characterising it, but by opening it up to the pulse of
                        the living in which any kind of literature is
                        interested. It is this pulse that any creative practice
                        naturally seeks to tap and explore, from the Arnhem Land
                        or the Lascaux frescoes to the birth of a literature, in
                        the Western sense of the term, among societies some
                        might regard as « deprived of writing, » about which we
                        must never forget that, although quite different, they
                        remain above all contemporary to one another.

                      <p>
                        In New Caledonia, is there such a debate about what
                        literature is, or at least about what it should not be?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The society born from the Nouméa Agreement, still under
                        construction, expects its writers to serve it and to
                        help define itself. Although this society keeps them at
                        a safe distance and on the fringe – despite the
                        writers&rsquo; own complaints – it enjoins them to
                        participate in the community of destiny to which it has
                        officially committed itself to build.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As for the writers themselves, like the country&rsquo;s
                        other artists, they seldom have the strength to turn
                        this society away, even though they are not happy being
                        – subtly – commanded, torn as they are between their
                        guilty desire to affirm their radical independence and
                        their notable submission to the petty laurels handed out
                        from time to time. They feel responsible and they are
                        right in doing so, but as writers, they might get lost
                        when trying to exercise this responsibility with regard
                        to the community.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        They are thus tempted to subject their writing to the
                        affirmation of some « Caledonitude » or « Kanakitude »
                        that should be immediately readable by the public at
                        large. Their work is then bound to get bogged down in
                        the mire of exotic clichés, thus contributing to
                        trivializing – that is, destroying – the creative energy
                        of a land that thereby loses any chance of making its
                        unique presence heard. Losing this presence, however,
                        would mean – for any of us – losing a bit of our
                        humanity.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The writers are all the more impatient to make
                        themselves heard, seen, and acknowledged as they are
                        acutely conscious of the race against time in the
                        lead-up to the referendum on self-determination
                        announced by the Noumea Agreement. Anything and
                        everything can then be lumped together under the heading
                        of what is called Caledonian literature. Narratives and
                        personal testimonies [<a href="#9">9</a>] are put on the
                        same footing as the painstaking search for an intimate
                        connection between language and the world. The outcome
                        of a writing workshop or some nice story for children
                        receives as much praise as an entire volume that reveals
                        a voice committed to casting off the finery of mere
                        facade.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Any attempt to exercise a critical judgement in the
                        public arena is more or less perceived as an attack
                        aimed at the country in the process of
                        self-construction. Those born here do not dare to do so,
                        although that does not mean that they do not think about
                        it sometimes. Those who have come here from elsewhere
                        are often too busy trying to get accepted, trying to get
                        an accolade – even if this sometimes means giving up all
                        illusions and their own internal demands.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If, however, after the unavoidable period of silent
                        listening, and while making sure that one always keeps
                        in mind the fact of one&rsquo;s ignorance – something
                        that is confirmed any time we encounter the Other –, one
                        dares to question these (phoney?) truths, one is
                        rejected with a rare violence. Non-Kanak natives are the
                        people who feel the least secure in their identity, and
                        they are also the ones who are the most prone to
                        dismissing the views of the « outsiders » as worthless.
                        In so doing, they hurt themselves much more than the
                        so-called « outsiders, » rejected on account of what
                        illegitimacy? They hurt that part of themselves whose
                        difference with the Kanak world they should not deny;
                        they should rather sever the connection of this
                        difference to one of its roots, admittedly the most
                        distant, but no less real than the others. Woe betide
                        the « outsider, » especially if he or she is French and
                        finds words to speak of this land in which s/he was not
                        born [<a href="#10">10</a>], and if s/he does so without
                        justifying him- or herself in one way or another.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If complete confusion reigns in the so-called « emerging
                        Caledonian literature, » the discrimination is
                        nonetheless made deep inside some people&rsquo;s minds,
                        or behind the scenes of those circles that appear and
                        disappear with the passing alliances. These alliances
                        are seldom freely chosen in any case, subject as they
                        are to formidable taboos that are left unsaid, and to
                        people looking over their shoulders, sometimes even
                        insulting one other in the media. These insults are
                        basically xenophobic, and symbolically murderous. We are
                        far from the « thick virgin forest of the real » that is
                        supposedly the common homeland to be explored and shared
                        by all.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With such reasoning, what would they do here, in New
                        Caledonia, with people such as Beckett, Kundera,
                        Fondane, Cioran, Césaire, Senghor; Kateb Yacine and so
                        many other migrant writers who are geographical,
                        linguistic and cultural migrants? The work of these
                        writers is celebrated precisely for having sprung from
                        two, three and even four « I »s.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I must dare say, as a « foreigner » who has been
                        « visited » – a resident here because this country lives
                        in me – that writers, whatever their points of
                        difference, or indeed their complete opposition to such
                        a way thinking, must accept urgently to engage in
                        discussion about these questions, without taboos or
                        aggression, in a public arena, free of passion.
                      </p>
                      <p>The stakes are high.</p>
                      <p>
                        Literature, or what passes as such, is indeed far from
                        being « an assault on the last earthly frontier, » as
                        Kafka declared. It runs the risk of becoming another
                        soulless slab of stone contributing not to a new agora
                        or a common destiny, but rather to the construction of
                        one more wall blocking out any open perspective on the
                        island&rsquo;s future. What seeks to be an assertion of
                        identity in fact, paradoxically, ends up denying the
                        age-old xenophile intelligence of Pacific island
                        societies.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        People committed to writing regularly stumble into the
                        pitfalls mentioned by Juan José Saer and Gao Xingjian.
                        Their writing becomes a tool put in the service of a
                        struggle whose validity I do not aim to judge while
                        asserting that this fight nonetheless traps, restricts,
                        and diverts literature from its reason for being.
                      </p>
                      <p>What is this reason?</p>
                      <p>
                        Obstinately, we must remind ourselves to make, humbly
                        and obstinately, the weak voice of one individual among
                        other individuals heard: an individual who may be
                        Caledonian, Oceanian (or whatever), but whose main
                        purpose is to remain the « keeper of the possible, »
                        committed to his gigantic task.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This task does not consist in speaking of an identity
                        that exists prior to writing.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This task cannot aim to build any kind of citizenship.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It is a task whose goal for the writer is to be him- or
                        herself, and to be in the world, completely.
                      </p>
                      <p>When writing, that is all that matters.</p>
                      <p>Being a Person.</p>
                      <p>Becoming human.</p>
                      <p>Wanting to be alive, absolutely human and alive.</p>
                      <p>
                        Striving somehow to become « Do Kamo, » the man who is
                        alive, the true human, in a number of Kanak languages.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In so doing, the individual marches forward, saying
                        « No » to all that threatens what is absolutely alive,
                        absolutely human [<a href="#11">11</a>].
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then, and only then, literature might help to open a
                        door, perhaps more than one door. From it, a small
                        fragment of mankind living here now might become a bit
                        more aware of itself, finding the words to express
                        itself in a different manner and to name the world
                        differently, looking directly at itself, laughing at
                        itself, shedding collective tears for the dead, and
                        celebrating the living.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then, and only then, this small fragment of mankind
                        might recognize itself as a people, as a nation, as a
                        community sharing a common fate, the same « weak and
                        harsh » voice, the mark left by the glowing solitude of
                        this individual among other individuals, whose only
                        worth consists in standing in the night, free, as a
                        sentry, simply happy when, from time to time, a fellow
                        human&rsquo;s hand is held out to his or hers. An
                        indeterminate, non-descript person. A man without
                        qualities.

                        intellectual who launched what has been called the
                        « Melanesian cultural awakening. » He was also a
                        pro-independence leader, and one of the signatories of
                        the Matignon-Oudinot Agreement. He was assassinated on 5
                        May 1989 by a fellow Kanak who regarded this signing as
                        a betrayal. [<a href="#n5">back to text</a>]

                        notion of literature clearer. The purpose is not at all
                        to create a hierarchy or to deny the interest of these
                        life stories, or testimonies, that become books, as they
                        are a necessary part in the construction of a shared
                        memory. The eminently fictional dimension of any memory,
                        either of the self or of the world, should not be
                        forgotten. Everyone knows the more or less conscious
                        revisionisms that can be brought when mixing past
                        events, which can only be captured in a vague and
                        fragmentary way, with their representations.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Some of these accounts, of course, can become
                        autofictions, in which language becomes predominant as
                        the events and feelings recounted turn into writing
                        material, colors on the painter&rsquo;s palette. What is
                        interesting is <em>how</em> they go together, classify,
                        interact, vibrate, resound. This is what gives a
                        painting power and a book its strength.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The same goes for what is called « adolescent » or
                        « children&rsquo;s » literature. On the one hand, we
                        have stories whose main quality – and it is not the
                        least – is that they are shared by a generation of
                        readers who thereby acquire common references. On the
                        other hand, we also have some stories, sometimes the
                        same ones, that will reach a level where the words and
                        the world match enough to transform the former and the
                        representation that the readers have of the latter. [<a

                        philosopher, wrote these remarkable words in the preface
                        to the new edition of the 1952 text by Jean
                        Mariotti, <em
                          >A Quest for a harmonious life with Nature in the
                          Melanesian world</em
                        >, by Jean Mariotti (<em
                          >La conquête du séjour paisible, </em
                        >Nouméa: Grain de sable, 2003): « Why could not someone
                        who is culturally different, the White man in this case,
                        do better than I in putting into words, translating my
                        inner, personal, fundamentally original thoughts? Even
                        if some ambiguities remain, they do not take away from
                        the fantastic nature of the adventure. Quite the
                        opposite. » Further on, in the same presentation of the
                        new edition, Hombouy stresses what he regards as the
                        legitimacy of Jean Mariotti: having written not
                        « about » but « through, » and « with » Kanak culture.
                        He has listened and has let himself be visited. [<a

                        numerous, from the wall being built in Palestine to the
                        violated rights of the most ancient people on Earth,
                        whose children, as Alexis Wright has noted, having lost
                        all hope, hang themselves to live electric cables in the
                        main streets of isolated Aboriginal communities
                        saturated with alcohol. They destroy themselves just
                        like so many young people do here in New Caledonia.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Thus Alexis Wright in Australia, Alan Duff in New
                        Zealand, Sia Figiel in Samoa, but also Salman Rushdie in
                        his exile, and so many others, even here in New
                        Caledonia, say « No. » They do not try to convey an
                        idyllic, exotic or nostalgic picture of the world. They
                        try to find words to say what threatens that which is
                        absolutely human, absolutely alive in us: a fair,
                        lively, and human language that reveals and enlightens,
                        but also collides, shocks and delves into the deepest
                        recesses of our inhumanity.

                      <p>
                        In so doing they commit themselves without relinquishing
                        any part of the experience expressed by Wright, the
                        author of <em>Plains of Promise</em> (<em
                          >Plaines de l&rsquo;espoir</em
                        >) and <em>The Pact of the Raimbow Snake</em> (<em
                          >Pacte du serpent arc-en-ciel</em
                        >), who writes, in <em>Believe in the Unbelievable</em
                        > (<em>Croire en l&rsquo;incroyable</em>): « I often
                        realised that nobody could accompany me in my travels,
                        as I often took an alternative path – the perilous one.
                        It was not necessarily the shortest one, but I felt that
                        it was the closest to the country&rsquo;s reality. »

                        Alexis Wright would thus be similar to Saer and Gao
                        Xinjian: they are alone, forever alone and yet
                        inhabited, visiting and visited, a keeper of our
                        possible humanity. [<a href="#n11">back to text</a>]
